## Metar WX Version 1

This Project was a quick project made in React for geting the Metar and Taf reports for Airports based on their ICAO identifier. Useful for aviation weather planning.<br /><br />
Uses lscache in the localstorage to cache requests for 15 minutes. I might make V2 full stack and handle caching in a DB.

Example:<br />
KSFO: San Francisco airport<br />
KJFK: JFK airport<br />
EGLL: London Heathrow airport<br />
EHAM: Amsterdam Schiphol airport<br />
EPWA: Warsaw airport<br />
LEMG: Malaga airport<br />
